# ToDoTime
A little to-do list that I created a a personal project


This came about from a university club portfolio-project prompt. We were asked to create a simple task tracker within a fortnight and I chose to do mine in WPF. 
In just over a week I was able to come up with this little fella and I'm quite proud given that this is not only my first time creating a project with a GUI, but
also my first time playing with C# and WPF.
