# ToDoTime
A little to-do list that I created a a personal project

## How This Came About
I created ToDoTime as a personal project to learn C# and the WPF framework. I was prompted to create a simple task tracker within 2 weeks and I am quite proud of what I've made!

## Features
As of right now you can:
  - Create tasks
  - Delete tasks

## Future Improvements
In the future I plan to
  - Save tasks inbetween sessions
  - Add keyboard shortcuts


## Reflection
Overall I'm quite proud of this little project, its the first time I have worked with a GUI before, on top of being the first time I have worked properly with C# and WPF. While there are many improvements that could be made, I believe that for a first attempt, I did quite well.
